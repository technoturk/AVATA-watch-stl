AVATA WATCH CASE V0.1 .
---------------------

2 versions of avata watch case.
	1. Avata no glass whas made for prototype .
	2. Avata glass is the final.
	
To get the best results on 3d printing you have tou use PETG material with the smallest nozzle available (0.25mm).
 
You need a 24mm wrist band, 
Plexyglass metrics are 1 x 39 mm (thickness x dia).

Pay atention on the wrist strap pins, the hole is only 1mm deep and can easy snap off in a short time. this hole must be filled with a 1mm tube.
